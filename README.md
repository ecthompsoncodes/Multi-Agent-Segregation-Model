# Schelling Segregation Model

## Overview
This project simulated Schelling's Segregation  Model. The simulation is run using Python and the Mesa library. This Code was written using Python 3.12.6.

## Packages Used
The following Python packages are required:
- `mesa`: For agent-based modeling.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib`: For creating visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For advanced visualizations.

These packages are included in the requirements.txt file in this folder.

## Running the simluation
The simulation is contained in the Jupyter Notebook: schelling_model.ipynb.

All code, including classes, simulations, visualizations and further analysis are included in the notebook file.
